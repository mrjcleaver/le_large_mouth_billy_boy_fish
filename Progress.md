* Downloaded Mega 2560 examples kit from
* Started Sound Sensor Example.ino (exercise 20)
* Ran the Serial Plotter
* Altered potiometer to adjust digital detection threshold. This flashes the LED when it detects music playing
* The sound sensor has a built in microphone, and no audio
* --
* Next - integrate the Sound Sensor module into the main circuit so that sounds drive motion.
